It’s full name is Fujifilm XC 50-230mm F4.5-6.7 OIS II, and I picked it up last year as I wanted a zoom but I’d heard a new 70-300mm was coming, so didn’t want to spend more on the 55-200. I’d looked at the 55-200 but with a zoom you always want more reach, so it seemed sensible to wait and get this cheap lens. It also has a bit more reach. The f/6.7 is pretty slow. Outdoors in good sunshine, you don’t mind much but if it starts to get overcast then the ISO starts jumping. This lens is so light though - only 375g! Compared to the 580g of the 55-200. It’s all plastic so that’s how it does it but it feels really easy to carry. I think it would be good on the smaller X-T10/20/30s.

Was messing about in the garden with the kids on a nice sunny day, and thought I’d try it on a some insect life. I think they’re reasonable:
